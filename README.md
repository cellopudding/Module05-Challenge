## Description 

User Story: AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To meet the needs of this user story I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to enter and save events for each hour of a typical 9am-5pm work day. The information saved in local storage will also persist should the user exit and/or refresh the browser page. For visual asthetics the past hours on the calendar will be displayed in grey, the present hour will be displayed in red, and future hours will be displayed in green. As an added feature I coded in a function that will automatically clear the local storage every week. This feature can easily be altered should the user prefer the storage be cleared daily, monthly, or not at all.
